/**
 * Public facade for parsing GraphQL Filter DSL expressions into Rules.
 *
 * Provides a clean interface for converting GraphQL-style filter objects
 * into executable Rule objects. This class follows the standardized DSL facade
 * pattern that should be replicated across all DSL implementations.
 *
 * Pattern: Each DSL should provide three public classes:
 * - {DSL}Parser: Parse DSL strings → Rule objects
 * - {DSL}Serializer: Serialize Rule objects → DSL strings
 * - {DSL}Validator: Validate DSL strings without full parsing
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```php
 * $parser = new GraphQLFilterParser();
 * $rule = $parser->parse(['age' => ['gte' => 18], 'country' => ['in' => ['US', 'CA']]]);
 * $result = $rule->evaluate($context);
 * ```
